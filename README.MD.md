\#\#Task 2 I have automated to test main work flows like basic
calculations in the income and expense calculator. The second scenario I
automated is to test income and expense get added in the right category.
The third test is to check that the pro functionality is not available
in the free version. I have used Android Studio Emulator to perform the
test automation tasks.

I have used following tools: 1. Android Studio (Google Pixel 4 Emulator
and downloaded app from it's playstore) 2. Java Eclipse (for coding) 3.
Appium GUI (to monitor logs) and Appium Inspector(to identify elements
e.g by id, by xpath etc)

I have kept it simple just to run the main functionality of the app. I
also automated the onboarding screens as everytime when I launch the app
in the emulator, the onboarding screens get displayed.

P.S I do know the crux of test automation, and if given a chance I will quickly learn and incorporate the best coding practices.
